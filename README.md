# nrealus' AI Planning Research Repository

A long-term personal research project in AI planning and acting.

Its main interest in uncertainty handling in an integrated planning and acting framework. For now, the main focus is in temporal uncertainty. Non-temporal uncertainty will (hopefully) be focused on later as well.

The general idea and current roadmap will be added later.
